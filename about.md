I became a biology major after a class I took through Systems Science where I was introduced to the study of ant colonies and their behavior.  In retrospect, I think I was more interested in modeling complex systems than in actual biology. I took a couple computer science classes as an undergrad, and my honors thesis was an analysis of a small ecological data set I collected, but it wasn't until after I graduated and decided not to pursue a PhD that I started programming seriously. 

I took a class on modeling and simulation with R and Python -- my first introduction to R -- through Systems Science (coming full circle) and decided to get my masters from the same department. Since fall 2017, I've held two data analyst internships, finished a graduate certificate in Business Intelligence & Analytics, and completed most of my masters program. 

I'm interested in computer modeling and simulation, applying operations research techniques, and smart transportation (driverless cars, dockless bikes) in smart cities. 

I currently work with bike data at biketownpdx. I do a variety of things daily, all data related (data science, data analysis, data engineering, software development). 

Outside of work I enjoy playing the piano, playing with data (and writing about it), cooking a variety of foods, and trying new mixed drinks.
