As an undergrad I took a class through Systems Science where I was introduced to the dynamics of ant colonies and their complex behavior emerging from the simple behavior of ants. I became a biology major, but in retrospect I was more interested in modeling complex systems than biology itself. For my Honors Thesis I did a data analysis of a small ecological dataset which was my first push into the data world.

I took another class from Systems Science as a postbac, where I learned modeling & simulation with R & Python -- and then decided to do my Master's as well. Systems Science means different things to different people, but to me it's a scientific field that blends computer simulation, operations research, data analysis, and systems thinking to generate pragmatic and effective solutions to business problems.

I currently work for Lyft Bikes and Scooters, [which recently bought my former employer (Biketown) and its parent company (Motivate)](https://blog.lyft.com/posts/lyft-becomes-americas-largest-bikeshare-service).
