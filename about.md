I became a biology major after a class I took through Systems Science where I was introduced to the study of ant colonies and their behavior.  In retrospect, I think I was more interested in modeling complex systems than in actual biology. I took a couple computer science classes as an undergrad, and my honors thesis was an analysis of a small ecological data set I collected, but it wasn't until after I graduated and decided not to pursue a PhD that I started programming seriously. 

I took a class on modeling and simulation with R and Python -- my first introduction to R -- through Systems Science (coming full circle) and decided to get my masters from the same department. Since fall 2017, I've held two data analyst internships, finished a graduate certificate in Business Intelligence & Analytics, and completed most of my masters program. 

I'm interested in computer modeling and simulation, applying operations research techniques, and smart transportation (driverless cars, dockless bikes) in smart cities. 

I currently work with bike data at biketownpdx. I do a variety of things daily, all data related (data science, data analysis, data engineering, software development). 

Fun work projects I've worked on include: 
* A discrete event simulation model that incorporates seasonal and time-of-day ridership to determine the best allocation of bikes in areas across the city (which was quite useful when firmware issues broke a lot of bikes)

* Quantifying bike availability through a variety of metrics I implemented so they can be tracked moth over month

* Building several different R Shiny apps (including maps and dashboards) to keep track of bikes in the field and how the system is performing. 

Though I mostly use R at work, I'm also familiar with Python, SQL, and Tableau. I've played with AWS offerings (EC2 instances, RDS, S3 buckets) both at my job and in my spare time. 

Other fun projects I've done:

* Building an agent-based model of animal predation, with object orientation, in Python

* Simulating ant foraging behavior with an agent-based model in NetLogo

Outside of work I enjoy playing the piano, playing with data (and writing about it), cooking a variety of foods, and trying new mixed drinks.
