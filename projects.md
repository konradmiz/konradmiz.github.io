Fun work projects I've worked on include: 
* A discrete event simulation model that incorporates seasonal and time-of-day ridership to determine the best allocation of bikes in areas across the city (which was quite useful when firmware issues broke a lot of bikes)

* Quantifying bike availability through a variety of metrics I implemented so they can be tracked moth over month

* Building several different R Shiny apps (including maps and dashboards) to keep track of bikes in the field and how the system is performing. 

Though I mostly use R at work, I'm also familiar with Python, SQL, and Tableau. I've played with AWS offerings (EC2 instances, RDS, S3 buckets) both at my job and in my spare time. 

Other fun projects I've done:

* Building an agent-based model of animal predation, with object orientation, in Python
